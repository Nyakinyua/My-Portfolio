    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Having undergone the 844 system, my education has been more like a journey. I started school at an early age and by the time I was 5 years I was enrolled in class one at <b><em>olympic primary school</em></b> .Fast forward to high school i joined <b><em>Kapropita Girls High school</em></b> where i discovered my passion for software engineering. little did i know that my dream of becoming a developer would be cut short by the kuccps, placement program for university students. But that wouldn't really stop me though, it was just a set back. I joined <b><em>Maasai mara University</em></b> in Narok county where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Human Resource Management.<br>
        After graduaton, a friend of mine who happens to be an alumni of <em><b>Moringa School</b></em> recommended me to join the school since she was aware of my passion for software development. It took me a while to be convinced that it was the right decision. I honestly wasn't finding any fulfillment in my job. I weighed my options and I decided to do what I love, and here we are!</p></div>
