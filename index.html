            <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Having undergone the 844 system, my education has been more like a journey. I started school at an early age and by the time I was 5 years I was enrolled in class one at olympic primary school.Fast forward to high i joined kapropita Girls High school where i discovered my passion for software engineering. little did i know that my dream of becoming a developer would be cut short by the kuccps, placement program for university students. But that wouldn't really stop me though, it was just a set back. I joined Maasai mara University in Narok county where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Human Resource Management.<br>
         After graduaton, a friend of mine who happens to be an alumni of Moringa School recommended me to join the school since she was aware of my passion for software development. It took me a while to be convinced that it was the right decision. I honestly wasn't finding any fulfillment in my job. I weighed my options and I decided to do what I love, and here we are!</p>
